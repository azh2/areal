Areal interpolation is the process making estimates about the population features from a source set of polygons to an overlapping but incongruent set of target polygons. One challenge with areal interpolation is that, while the processes themselves are well documented, implementing them often involves "reinventing the wheel." Within `R`, the `sf` package does offer a basic interface for areal weighted interpolation (`st_interpolate_aw`). The `areal` package is designed to provide a suite of interpolation functions that provide a more full-featured workflow that fits into both modern data management (e.g. `tidyverse`) and spatial data (e.g. `sf`) frameworks.

## Installation
### Installing Dependencies
You should check the [`sf` package website](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for the latest details on installing dependencies for that package. Instructions vary significantly by operating system. For best results, have `sf` installed before you install `areal`. Other dependencies, like `dplyr`, will be installed automatically with `areal` if they are not already present.

The one exception here is the dependency `lwgeom`, which Linux users will need to follow some [spatial instructions](https://github.com/r-spatial/lwgeom) to install correctly.

### Installing areal
The development version of `areal` can be accessed from Github with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/areal")
```

# Introduction
Population data are often available at various levels of aggregation, such as census tracts or block groups in the United States or output areas in the United Kingdom. These units are often drawn for convenience and not because they represent some sort of commonly accepted area in residents' lived experiences. Despite this, they are routinely used as "proxies" in neighborhood research since they are readily available and the techniques for estimating population values for overlapping but incongruent areas, such as a shapefile of neighborhood boundaries for a city, are less accessible. Thus researchers often resort to developing their own, often manual, implementations of the areal weighted interpolation workflow [@qiu2012development]. 

Unlike interpolation techniques like inverse distance weighted interpolation that are appropriate for point data, areal weighted interpolation is designed specifically for working with already aggregated data to some set of polygon spatial features [@lam1983spatial]. Estimating population values from these data to an overlapping but incongruent set of polygon features is known as the *polygon overlay problem* [@goodchild1978statistical], with the original data known as the "source" data and the overlapping set of features known as the "target" data [@markoff1973linkage]. The estimation process vary based on whether data are spatially *extensive* (i.e. count data) or spatially *intensive* [i.e. ratios, percentages, means, or medians; @goodchild1980areal].

In estimating values for the target features, areal weighted interpolation makes a significant assumption that individuals are evenly spread throughout the source features [@qiu2012development]. This assumption often breaks down in practice - a census tract with a large park in it, for example, or a neighborhood that has a significant commercial area alongside residential housing. While more complex methods do exist to compensate for violating this assumption, there are few tools to implement them and the strategies have remained largely the focus of academics instead of GIS practitioners [@langford2007rapid; @qiu2012development].

# The `areal` R package
The `areal` package aims to reduce the barriers to implementation areal interpolation in spatial researchers' work. By implementing the process in `R`, we aim to improve the reproducibility of the interpolation process, which is often done manually using point-and-click desktop GIS software. We also aim to provide additional functionality in comparison to the one existing approach found in the `sf` package [@pebesma2018simple] while providing support for modern data management (e.g. `tidyverse`) and spatial data (e.g. `sf`) frameworks. 

We therefore provide functions that:

1. validate data suitability for areal interpolation,
2. allow for friction-less, iterative interpolation of both spatially extensive and intensive data, and
3. provide a manual workflow for implementing the interpolation process.

Unlike existing approaches, the `areal` package offers the ability to interpolate multiple variables in a single function call, and provides a wider set of options for making these estimates. For spatially extensive interpolations, we offer a formula that matches the existing functionality in `sf` as well as a second formula that is more suitable for data where there should be complete overlap between the source and target data but, because of data quality issues, there is not. Providing a manual approach alongside the primary function `aw_interpolate()` is important for users who need to open the traditional "black box" of interpolation and diagnose data issues that occur during interpolation. Finally, `areal` provides both spatial (`sf` object) and a-spatial (`tibble` object) options for output.

# A Short Example
Once data have been prepared for interpolation (i.e. they share the same projected coordinate system and there are no conflicts between variable names), interpolations can be calculated with a single function `aw_interpolate()`. This functionality is illustrated here using source and target data built in to the `areal` package:

```r
> aw_interpolate(ar_stl_wards, tid = WARD, source = ar_stl_race, sid = GEOID, weight = "sum",
+                output = "sf", extensive = c("TOTAL_E", "WHITE_E", "BLACK_E"))

Spatially intensive interpolations can be calculated by replacing the `extensive` argument with `intensive`. Alternatively, both arguments and corresponding vectors of variable names can be provided to simultaneously interpolate both spatially extensive and intensive data. 

The source data from the above data along with one of the variables, total population (`TOTAL_E`), are mapped in panal A below. The resulting data for the total population variable in interpolated to the target data are mapped in panal B:
